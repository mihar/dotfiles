# Base environment setup

This are the base config files and settings I use on my work and personal machines.

If you use Dropbox, it's also a nice way to keep all of your things in sync. *iTerm 2* works well with config file syncing over Dropbox. Just symlink the files as instructed below and you should be good to go.

## Key features

- VIM everywhere (NeoVim obviously, VS Code, Fish shell, Safari)
- GPG through Keybase
- Good typography
- OS X light/dark theme respected in VS Code, iTerm, bat, delta
- TBC

Here's how my editor looks like:

Here's how my terminal looks like:

## The Dock

Remove the annoying delay with Dock auto-hiding:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock
```

## Reduce animations

To make things appear snappier, remove unnecessary animations:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0
```

## Screenshot location

I like to keep my Desktop clean, so let's change the default location where screenshots are saved:

```bash
mkdir ~/Screenshots
$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Screenshots && killall SystemUIServer
```

```

## SSH

Create a new key if you need it:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```

## GPG

Let's setup GPG for commit signing and other shenanigans.

### Keybase

Keybase is a great way to start using GPG, they'll generate your keys and host them for you.

If you don't yet have an account, go to [https://keybase.io](https://keybase.io) and create it.

Then login on your computer and the `keybase id` command should output your data.

```bash
keybase login
keybase id
```

#### Making Keybase behave

Keybase by default installs a lot of crap you probably don't need. A slow JS-based UI, Fuse encrypted networking, chats, etc.

The following will trim all the fat and leave the good: CLI.

```bash
/Applications/Keybase.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/keybase install -c cli
keybase ctl stop
keybase uninstall -c fuse
keybase uninstall -c helper
keybase uninstall -c kbfs
keybase uninstall -c service
keybase uninstall -c updater
sudo pkill -TERM keybase.Helper
sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/keybase.Helper.plist
sudo rm -f /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/keybase.Helper
```

An essential step is also aliasing the `keybase` command to `keybase --standalone`, which will stop complaining about the agent not running in the background.

This is accomplished in the `aliases.fish` file, so you don't need to do it.

As a final step, let's make Keybase use the `pinentry-mac` so our passwords can be securely stored in the OS X Keychain.

```bash
keybase config set pinentry.path /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac
```

#### If you don't have a GPG key yet

Let's create a new key on Keybase specifically for use in GPG on our computer.

```bash
keybase pgp gen --multi
```

#### If you have a GPG key already

If you have your key on another machine, you can run `keybase pgp export` to see all the available keys to you.
Otherwise skip to the [Importing existing GPG key].

```bash
$ keybase pgp export
# â–¶ WARNING Found several matches:
# user: Miha Rebernik <miha@rebernik.info>
# 4096-bit RSA key, ID 6B997648324AF29E, created 2019-08-19
```

Now export it with (it'll ask you for a password with which to encrypt it, you should add it):

```bash
keybase pgp export -q 6B997648324AF29E -s > pgp_key
```

Now get your `pgp_key` file to the new machine where you're setting GPG up.

##### Importing existing GPG key

Run this command to import the private key into Keybase first, and then into GPG.

This will first ask you for the password you used to encrypt this key, so it can decrypt it and import it.
Then it will also ask you for a password with which to securely store the key on your machine. This password
will be needed every time you try to use this key to sign or decrypt something (it will later be handled transparently by `pinentry-mac`).

```bash
keybase pgp import -i pgp_key
keybase pgp export -q 6B997648324AF29E --secret | gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import
```

### Setting GPG and Git

Now we'll list available keys and set the default key for Git

```bash
$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
# /Users/mihar/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
# -------------------------------
# sec   rsa4096/6B997648324AF29E 2019-08-19 [SC] [expires: 2035-08-15]
# uid                 [ unknown] Miha Rebernik <miha@rebernik.info>
# ssb   rsa4096/BB08A4DB17E7EC97 2019-08-19 [E] [expires: 2035-08-15]

$ git config --global user.signingkey 6B997648324AF29E
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

If you need to add the key to Github or anywhere else, you can use this command:

```bash
keybase pgp export -q 6B997648324AF29E | pbcopy
```

Now link the config files in this repo:

```bash
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/gpg.conf ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/gpg-agent.conf ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
```

And restart the GPG agent:

```bash
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

### Testing GPG

Test everything works as needed by doing:

```bash
echo "testing GPG" | gpg --clearsign
```

You should see no errors and a plaintest message you've inputted along with a signature.

## Safari extensions

For `sVimcss` load the gist `842ac422e7ead649f9a946cdd2e12bde`.

## dotfiles

```bash
cd ~
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/gemrc .gemrc
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/gitconfig .gitconfig
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/init.vim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim

```

### Fish

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/conf.d
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/fish/aliases.fish ~/.config/fish/conf.d/aliases.fish
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/fish/config.fish ~/.config/fish/conf.d/config.fish
```

### Bash

```bash
cd ~
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/bash/bash_profile .bash_profile
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/home/bash/bashrc .bashrc
```

## VS Code

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor and use the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) package to sync via Github gists.

Since I use Vim mode in VS Code, one handy setting is also turning off letter accent suggestings on pressing, which makes it possible to hold `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` and others and it'll repeat the motion.

```bash
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

## NeoVim

Lets link nvim to vim for less hassle:

```bash
ln -s /usr/local/bin/nvim /usr/local/bin/vim
```

Now install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/autoload
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim > ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim
vim +PlugInstall +qall
```

**Some of the plugins that you get:**

* spacegray color scheme
* fzf
* ack
* fugitive
* ruby
* javascript

## Install all software updates

```bash
softwareupdate -i -a
```

## iTerm 2

iTerm has a nice convenient way of overriding which directory houses your settings.

![](http://i.imgur.com/pwGCOrj.png)

Then we need to link the theme change script to it's AutoLaunch directory.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch
ln -s ~/Code/dotenv/iterm2/theme_switch.py ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch/theme_switch.py
```

## Font

For my editor usage I use **Meslo**, which is a customized version of Apple's Menlo typeface. Main differentiator is that it offers three different line-heights baked into the type, because back in the day, most terminal applications were oblivious to the importance of such a setting.

For terminal support of the bob the fish theme, I use a [patched version of Meslo](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Meslo) from the [Nerd Fonts project](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Meslo).

iTerm 2 has such a setting now, but I still prefer to use the **Meslo LG L DZ** at 12pts.

For more information look at this [blog post](http://mir.aculo.us/2010/10/12/the-long-search-for-a-terminal-font-is-over/).

The font files can be downloaded from GitHub here:

* [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font/downloads)
* [Meslo Nerd patched](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)
